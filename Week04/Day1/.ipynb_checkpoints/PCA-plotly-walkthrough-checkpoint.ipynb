    "This page first shows how to visualize higher dimension data using various Plotly figures combined with dimensionality reduction (aka projection). Then, we dive into the specific details of our projection algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Scikit-learn to load one of the datasets, and apply dimensionality reduction. Scikit-learn is a popular Machine Learning (ML) library that offers various tools for creating and training ML algorithms, feature engineering, data cleaning, and evaluating and testing models. It was designed to be accessible, and to work seamlessly with popular libraries like NumPy and Pandas.\n",

    "### High-dimensional PCA Analysis with px.scatter_matrix\n",
    "The dimensionality reduction technique we will be using is called the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is a powerful technique that arises from linear algebra and probability theory. In essence, it computes a matrix that represents the variation of your data (covariance matrix/eigenvectors), and rank them by their relevance (explained variance/eigenvalues). For a video tutorial, see this segment on PCA from the Coursera ML course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualize all the original dimensions\n",
    "First, let's plot all the features and see how the species in the Iris dataset are grouped. In a Scatter Plot Matrix (splom), each subplot displays a feature against another, so if we have $N$ features we have a $N \\times N$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we are plotting all 4 features from the Iris dataset, thus we can see how sepal_width is compared against sepal_length, then against petal_width, and so forth. Keep in mind how some pairs of features can more easily separate different species.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use Plotly Express, Plotly's high-level API for building figures."
